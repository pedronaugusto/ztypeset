# ztypeset — nothing this repository ignores is tracked by it.
#
# `.gitignore` names what does not belong in the history: build output, the
# packages `zig fetch` drops beside the project, object files carrying absolute
# paths from the machine that produced them, an editor's leftovers. Tracking
# overrides those rules, so a path added before its pattern existed — or added
# past it, or swept in by a blanket `git add -A` — sits in every clone forever
# and nothing says a word.
#
# That is not hypothetical. On 2026-09-03 a `zig fetch` had left 333 files
# under ./zig-pkg in a sibling package, `git add -A` committed them, and they
# reached a public main. What surfaced it was the executable-bit gate, which
# enumerates TRACKED .sh files: the fetched CI scripts appeared as violations
# of an unrelated rule.
#
# The patterns are not restated here. `git check-ignore` is asked, so
# `.gitignore` stays the one home and a rule added there is a gate for free.
#
#   ci/check-ignored.sh
#
# Exits non-zero if any tracked path matches an ignore rule.
