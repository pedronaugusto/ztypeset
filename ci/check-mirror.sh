# Refuses a local roster that has stopped mirroring the hosted one.
#
# `ci/run.sh` says at the top that it mirrors `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, so a
# failure can be reproduced on the machine that caused it. Nothing held that
# claim in ztypeset until this script existed, and where the same claim went
# unheld in a sibling package it was false: the workflow built a configuration
# the local roster did not, so an option declared in `build.zig` could be
# broken for as long as it took someone to open a pull request.
#
# What is compared is the set of BUILD OPTION COMBINATIONS each file executes:
# every `-D` on a build command except `-Dtarget` and `-Doptimize`, sorted so a
# step is identified by what it sets rather than by the order it sets it in,
# and taken as a set so a loop that expands to several commands counts once.
# Target and optimize mode are left out because the two files are legitimately
# different there — the workflow names a runner per platform and spells each
# mode out; the roster runs on whichever host it is invoked on and loops.
#
# Two details decide whether the comparison is honest:
#
#   * Logical lines, not physical ones. A shell command continued with `\`, or
#     a YAML folded scalar (`run: >-`), is ONE command whose options are spread
#     over several lines; read line by line, every option past the first line
#     is invisible and the step reads as unmatched. A literal block (`run: |`)
#     is the opposite case — several commands — so it is not folded.
#   * Only commands count. Options are read after the `build` word, because a
#     step's own label often quotes the option it is about ('test
#     -Dsimd=false (scalar codecs)'), and comment lines are dropped, because
#     prose naming an option beside the word "build" is not a step. Both
#     cases were found by running this against all seven packages: each
#     produced a phantom combination in exactly one of them.
